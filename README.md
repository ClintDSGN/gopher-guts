<h2>Villainous Portraiture</h2>
<p>
Bouncing around doing random over-flow work for design and marketing is putting a beating on my creativity, so I'm going to start tearing apart my current portfolio. It has been an amalgam of student work and the ultra-rare creative opportunity my workplaces have given me a chance to put my hands on. I know good design when I see it, and I've been through a four year design college. I've seen the people that are there to learn a new skill in order to make money, and I've seen the ones who care about the quality because they love what they do. I know which one I am, and I haven't given up. It has been a fight and I do not intend on letting it kill me.
<p>
I want to light a fire that burns bad, uncared-for, and unthoughtful design to the ground.
